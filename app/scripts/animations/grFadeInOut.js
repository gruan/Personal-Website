 *
 * grFadeInOut defines the fade in and fade out animation.
 *
 * To use: add the grFadeInOut class to the element. To include time delay after
 * each fade in and fade out animation, add the attribute 'delay="delayVal"' in ms.
 *
 * Ex. <div class="grFadeInOut" delay="1000">. This will create the fade in and
 * fade out animation with a 1000ms delay after each fade in and fade out animation.
